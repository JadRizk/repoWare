# RepoWare

A simple react client for Github's graphQL API ðŸš€

In short, this project allows you to browse repositories available on Github using an infinite scroll. It uses the new Github GraphQL v4 and well the new `apollo/client` library.

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.google.com/search?q=typescrpt+official+docs&oq=typescrpt+official+docs+&aqs=chrome..69i57.8137j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
- [Apollo/client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/core/ApolloClient/)
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)

## Getting Started

To get this project running locally, please follow the instructions below. It's also important to note that the app doesn't contain an authentication feature yet. Meaning you will need to generate a private personal token on GitHub and add it to the `.env` file.

### Steps to generate your Github personal token:

1. Verify your email address, if it hasn't been verified yet.
2. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings.
3. In the left sidebar, click Developer settings.
4. In the left sidebar, click Personal access tokens.
5. Click Generate a new token.
6. Give your token a descriptive name.
7. Add your token to the `.env` file (use the `.env.example` for reference)

After following the steps above, please use the `.env.example` as an example to store your token.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JadRizk/repoWare.git

cd repoWare/

yarn -or- npm  i

yarn start or npm run start
```

Open your localhost on port [3000](http://localhost:3000) to the project running the browser.
